=== 0.0.7
 * Fixed a bug relating to properly recognizing ActiveRecord::TimeWithZone
 * DATETIME propertyvalues will now return an instance of TimeWithZone instead of DateTime when
   activesupport is present, and it is appropriate. See the README for details
=== 0.0.6
 * Added rake tasks to run specs with either the tzinfo gem or activesupport (<=2.2)
 * Default rake task now runs both of these
=== 0.0.5
 * Fixed a bug in occurrence enumeration reported by paulsm on github
=== 0.0.4
 * Fixed a bug in imported timezones reported by paulsm on github
=== 0.0.3
 * Added tzid method to Ruby Time and DateTime instances, and to ActiveRecord::TimeWithZone if it is defined this method is used to determine the desired
timezone when an instance of one of these classes is given as the value of a datetime property.  If the tzid is nil then the default tzid is used,
if it is set to :floating then the property will be a floating time.
 * Removed the ability to pass an array with a tzid string and a date-time since the above made it unnecessary
 * The ruby datetime property returned from the ruby_value method on the DateTime property will return an instance of ::DateTime with:
   ** The proper utc offset
   ** The tzid set to the right tzid
 * Made exdate/rdate building possible
 * Added a default_tzid attribute to the Calendar component, if this attribute is not set for a particular calendar it will delegate to the default set 
for the DateTime property class.
 * Added fix patches from
